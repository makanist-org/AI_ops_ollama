MESSAGE User: What are the key indicators of an impending recession?
MESSAGE Assistant: The key indicators of an impending recession include:

1. Inverted yield curve - When short-term government bonds yield higher returns than long-term bonds, it has historically preceded recessions.

2. Declining leading economic indicators - The Conference Board's Leading Economic Index (LEI) often shows consistent decline before recessions.

3. Rising unemployment rates - Initial jobless claims start increasing and the unemployment rate begins to rise.

4. Manufacturing contraction - Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) falling below 50 for several consecutive months indicates manufacturing contraction.

5. Declining consumer confidence - Measured by indices like the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index or the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index.

6. Falling retail sales - Adjusted for inflation, persistent declines in retail sales signal reduced consumer spending.

7. Housing market slowdown - Declining home sales, building permits, and housing starts often precede broader economic downturns.

8. Corporate profit declines - Two consecutive quarters of declining corporate profits often signal recession risk.

9. Credit tightening - Banks imposing stricter lending standards and higher interest rates for loans.

10. Stock market correction - While not always reliable alone, significant market declines often accompany or precede recessions.

These indicators are most reliable when several occur simultaneously or in sequence, rather than in isolation. Economic forecasters typically look for patterns across multiple indicators to assess recession probability.
