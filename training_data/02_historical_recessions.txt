MESSAGE Assistant: Here are the major recessions in US history and their primary causes:

1. The Great Depression (1929-1939):
   - Triggered by the stock market crash of October 1929
   - Exacerbated by banking panics and monetary contraction
   - Poor policy responses including Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act
   - Widespread bank failures and 25% unemployment at its peak

2. 1973-1975 Recession:
   - OPEC oil embargo quadrupled oil prices
   - Stagflation (high inflation with economic stagnation)
   - End of the Bretton Woods monetary system
   - Unemployment reached 9%

3. Early 1980s Recession (1981-1982):
   - Federal Reserve's tight monetary policy to combat inflation
   - Prime rate reached 21.5% in 1981
   - Unemployment peaked at 10.8%
   - Significant manufacturing sector contraction

4. Savings and Loan Crisis (late 1980s-early 1990s):
   - Deregulation of S&Ls combined with poor risk management
   - Commercial real estate collapse
   - Over 1,000 S&Ls failed
   - Cost taxpayers approximately $124 billion

5. Dot-com Bubble Burst (2001):
   - Excessive speculation in internet-based companies
   - Overvaluation of tech stocks

   - Compounded by 9/11 attacks

6. The Great Recession (2007-2009):
   - Subprime mortgage crisis
